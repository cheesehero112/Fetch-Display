# Fetch & Display



## Introduction

Fetch & Display is build with html, css and JavaScript. 

When the "fetch" button is presses, it makes a single API request, and displays a table containing user name, email, and phone data. 

After the table is displayed, additional button clicks will not make any API requests.
